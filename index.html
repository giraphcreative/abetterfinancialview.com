					<h2>Financially sound with a view toward you.</h2>
					<p>SoundView Financial Credit Union is a member-owned financial cooperative. That means that those who choose to have a banking relationship with us are the owners of the credit union, not rich investors. We provide all the services you might expect from a bank, but with lower fees and better rates on deposits and loans. In fact, since 2014 we've saved our member-owners over $1.3 million!</p>
					<p>We've been proudly serving the community for over 35 years and love to see our family continue to grow and save even more people money. SoundView membership is open to those who:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Live, work, worship or volunteer in the Connecticut counties of Fairfield or Litchfield;</li>
						<li>All P&amp;G/Gillette/Duracell employees and their families;</li>
						<li>Employees and their families from other SEG member companies in the greater Danbury area.</li>
					</ul>
